## Working with Git
-------------------

To get the repo in you local system  (for the first time use)

```
git clone <repo-clone-link>
```

Now if you add any contents or modified any contents, and you wish to stack them for pushing it in server

```
git add .
or 
git add <filepath with file extention>
```

Now after doing that you need to pass a message, to tell what this commit means or what it is suppose to do

``` 
git commit -m "<put your message here>"
or 
git commit (the terminal will open up a file, enter the commit message in that)
```

Now to push it to remote repo use 
```
git push -u
After this your credentials will be asked give the credentials and you should see the upload happening
```
